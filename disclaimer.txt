I downloaded Twitter data starting from June,1 until July, 26 using Getoldtweets3. 
Most of the tweets are in Russian. It's a lot of data to translate. For that reason, I used a smaller dataset (July, 18 â€“ 26) for particular candidates analysis. 
The toolkit: Python, Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, SpaCy, Scikit-learn, Vader, LDA
